This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use located on the Website.</p>

      <p class="text-uppercase">BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU ARE HEREBY CONSENTING TO OUR COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, TRANSFER AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

        <li>
          <p><span class="header">Applicability.</span>  While the Website is available to, and can be used by, anyone with internet access, the Website is intended to be accessed and used by individuals from the United States of America, and Crowdgate, LLC hereby disclaims any representations and/or warranties it makes in this Privacy Policy that such policy satisfies the requirements of users accessing and using the Website from outside the United States of America.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><span class="header">Information We Collect.</span>  When you use our Website, we may receive and collect certain information.  The information that we may receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit our Website.</p>
        </li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p><span class="header">Automatically Collected Information.</span>  Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from you when you visit our Website.  This information may include some or all of the following items: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using and the IP address of your Internet Service Provider; your approximate geographic location; the type and version of Internet browser software you use and your operating system; the type of mobile device you are using, mobile device IDs or other persistent identifiers; the date and time you access our site, the length of your stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that you access while visiting the site; the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, and if applicable, the search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases that you entered into the search engine to find this site; and demographic information concerning the country of origin of your computer or other device and the language(s) used by it.  We use this information to monitor the usage of our Website, assess its performance, ensure technological compatibility with your computer or mobile device, and understand the relative importance of the information provided on our Website.  We may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="header">Information Collected via Cookies.</span>  “Cookies” are small files or records that are placed on your computer’s hard drive to distinguish you from other visitors to our Website.  The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect or track information about your activities while using our Website.</p>
            <p>A cookie may enable the website owner to track how a visitor navigates through its website and the areas in which they show interest.  This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals.  Information gathered may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the site, and the website visited just before and just after a visit to our Website.</p>
            <p>Cookies can be set to expire: (1) on a specified date; (2) after a specific period of time; (3) when a transaction has been completed; or (4) when a user turns off his/her Internet browser.  A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie.  Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies.</p>
            <p>Our Website may use both “session cookies” and “permanent cookies.” Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit our Website or most websites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies.  You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placements.  If you refuse cookies, there may be parts of our Website that may not function properly.</p>

          <li>
            <p><span class="header">Information You May Actively Submit Through Our Website.</span>  For some of the browsing on our Website, we may either require or collect “User Information.”  User Information is information that could personally identify you, for example, your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information.  When you register, we also ask you to provide certain other personal information, including your birth year, gender, zip code, user name, and password (the “Registration Data”).  You can browse our Website and take as much time as you want to review our services without having to submit such User Information; however, in the following instances, we do need you to actively submit User Information and/or Registration Data: (1) when you want to contact us via electronic means or website submission; (2) when you utilize online ordering and purchase tickets for a specific event; (3) when you enter a contest or sweepstakes, if one is available; (4) when you join our customer loyalty programs, email lists, or social media networks; (5) when you wish to open an account to either host or sign up for events; (6) when you create a listing for an event through the Website; (7) when you respond to one of our surveys; or (7) when you share an event/listing with a third party platform (such as Facebook or Twitter).  E-mail or other forms of electronic communication, including website submissions, are not secure and/or confidential means of communication.</p>

          <p><span class="header">Security.</span>  We strive to maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that the Information (as defined below) you share with use is handled in a safe, secure and responsible manner.  We have security measures to help protect against loss, unauthorized access and alteration of the information in our control.  We will only disclose such Information to employees and authorized service providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Policy.  Our databases are protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures that restrict access to authorized person in accordance with this Policy.  Although no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, and we cannot ensure against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.</p>

          <p><span class="header">Personal Information About Children.</span>  Our Website is targeted primarily for use by adults.

Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect age identifying information, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 years.  However, we hereby advise all visitors to our site under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any personally identifiable information on our Website.

We do this by general marketing communications for our services, including by regular mail, e-mail, and social media, (collectively, “Marketing Communications”).  Unless you “opt-out” through opportunities available to you through our Marketing Communications, we may send you Marketing Communications.  You may also “opt-out” of future Marketing Communications by following the instructions provided in this Privacy Policy under the “Access to and Managing Your Information” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>We also may use your Information to analyze Website usage and location information, to better understand our users and improve the services, to protect against, identify or address wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of Use, to manage your account and provide you with customer service, and to generally manage the Website and our services.</p>
