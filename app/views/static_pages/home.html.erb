        <h3>What we're all about</h3>
        <p>
          Crowdgate is the first peer-to-peer marketplace for tailgating. We connect hosts of turnkey tailgates with fans looking for a hassle-free pregame experience. Our platform allows fans to search for a specific sporting event and then find and attend a tailgate before that event. In doing so, we are changing the way fans tailgate.
        </p>

        <p>
          More importantly than just tailgating, however, Crowdgate is about connecting people. We believe there is nothing like the experiencee in the parking lot before a big game. Joe Kahn, the Comissioner of Tailgating, has said that <strong>"the tailgate is the  last great American Neighborhood."</strong> We agree, and that's why we built Crowdgate. We want to give every fan access to that experience.

        <p>
          Some fans argue that the best part of gameday is the tailgate. Other fans argue that tailgating can be a hassle. Between setup and tear down, planning, food prep and parking- it's often just not worth it.

          Our hosts offer unique experiences to their guests. Some our professional chefs, offering unique culinary experiences. Some are lifelong fans, offering up stories of legen. Some are just rookies, try
