              I am a UCLA alum (twice) and have been tailgating at the Rose Bowl for almost a decade. I love to have fun, and most importantly, love to make sure my guests have fun too. I always have great food, coolers, chairs, and anything else that makes your day great. My favorite guests are those who are coming to the Rose Bowl for the first time.
