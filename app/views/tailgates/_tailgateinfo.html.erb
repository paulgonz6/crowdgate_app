      More infomration: We always host great tailgates. I typically have your normal tailgate food: burgers, hot dogs, chips, etc. My wife makes chili and some pasta salads- her chili is amazing! We welcome all guests and leave meeting fans from the away team. One heads up, we often get into some serious cornhole tournaments.
